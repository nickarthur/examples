  "readme": "# vrjs-trackr-key\nThis is an npm module for the [vrjs]() framework that implements a standard tracker with keyboard controls.  The keyboard tracker has 10 channels/sensors that can be toggled, allowing an application to \"track\" up to ten different sensors.\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm install vrjs-trackr-key`\n\n## Usage\n\nKeypresses control the current position and orientation of the active sensor\n```\nx/X - moves the active sensor along the x axis\ny/Y - moves the active sensor along the y axis\nz/Z - moves the active sensor along the z axis\nj/J - rotates the active sensor around x axis\nn/N - rotates the active sensor around y axis\nh/H - rotates the active sensor around z axis\n[0-9] - sets the active sensor\n```\n\nIn your code, you can create a trackr object with the THREE object:\n\n```js\nvar keytrackr = require('vrjs-trackr-key')\nvar trackr = keytrackr.make(THREE);\n```\n\nYou can add objects to sensors using the add method\n\n```js\ntrackr.add(object, sensor_number);\n```\n\nIn your animation loop, simply call the `poll` method and the module will automatically apply the sensor position and orientation to all tracked objects in the scene.\n\n```js\ntrackr.poll()\n```\n\nYou can apply optional positional offsets to the sensor and customized scalling using the `offset` and `scale` methods.  See source for details.\n\n\n",
